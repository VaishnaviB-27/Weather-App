Weather App
A simple weather application that shows current weather information for any city using OpenWeatherMap API.
I built this project to practice working with APIs and handling asynchronous JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data and displays temperature, wind speed, and weather conditions.
Features:

Search weather by city name
Displays temperature in Celsius
Shows wind speed and weather description
Clean and responsive design
Error handling for invalid city names

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS 
JavaScript (Fetch API)
OpenWeatherMap API

How to Use:

Open the application
Enter a city name in the input field
Click "Get weather details" button
View the weather information

Setup:
To run this project locally:
Clone the repository
Open index.html in your browser
That's it!

What I Learned:

Working with external APIs
Handling promises and async/await
Error handling in JavaScript
CSS Grid for layouts
Form validation

Future Improvements:

Add weather icons
Show 5-day forecast
Add geolocation feature
